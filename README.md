# jobforce_ML

jobforce_ML is a web application designed to extract and process data from PDF files. The application provides two main functionalities: extracting data using a standard method and extracting data using the Gemini AI model for more accurate results. The frontend is built with React and Bootstrap, while the backend is powered by Flask and various Python libraries for PDF processing and natural language processing (NLP).

## Key Functionalities

### PDF Upload and Extraction

1. **Standard Extraction**:
   - Users can upload PDF files through the frontend.
   - The backend processes the uploaded PDF to extract text and relevant details.
   - Extracted data includes fields like Name, Phone, and Address.

2. **Gemini AI Extraction**:
   - Users can opt to extract data using the Gemini AI model for improved accuracy.
   - The backend uses the Gemini API to process the text and extract details.

## Backend Details

- **Framework**: Flask
- **Key Routes**:
  - `/upload`: Handles PDF uploads and extracts data using standard methods.
  - `/extract_with_gemini`: Extracts data using the Gemini AI model.

- **Core Functions**:
  - `extract_text_from_pdf`: Extracts text from the PDF using pdfplumber.
  - `extract_details`: Uses spaCy's NER model to extract details from the text.
  - `extract_details_with_gemini`: Uses the Gemini API to extract details from the text.

## Frontend Details

- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: Bootstrap
- **Key Features**:
  - Upload PDF files.
  - View extracted data in an interactive interface.
  - Retry extraction using the Gemini AI model for improved accuracy.
- **API Communication**: Axios is used to make API requests to the backend.
